The **SecureAuthLab** project is an educational and hands-on demonstration designed to illustrate the critical importance of secure authentication practices in web applications. By creating a vulnerable Flask application that transmits sensitive user credentials over plain HTTP, the project clearly showcases the risks associated with unsecured data transmission. Through the use of Wireshark and its command-line counterpart, tshark, users can visually inspect and analyze network traffic to observe how easily credentials can be intercepted in plain text. The project then transitions to demonstrate the benefits of using HTTPS by configuring the Flask application to serve content over an encrypted connection, making it significantly more difficult for attackers to intercept and read sensitive information. This comprehensive approach not only educates users on the dangers of plain HTTP but also provides practical examples and resources to help implement best practices for securing web applications, making **SecureAuthLab** an invaluable tool for anyone looking to understand and enhance the security of their authentication processes.
